Let's say a regular language is described in a set builder notation, we want to do the following:
1. Convert it to a DFA or NFA
2. For a given string, check if it is in the language by simulating the DFA or NFA

To simulate a DFA
1. We start at the start state
2. For each character in the string, we follow the transition for that character
3. If we reach the end of the string and we are in an accepting state, then the string is in the language
